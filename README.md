# Healthcare-Dashboard
## Work-Flow
Halodoc Healthcare Project:

Step 1: Understand the KPIs from the customer:

a) Patient info according to the Patient id
b) Billing Information 
c) Bed Occupancy Breakdown
d) Overall Feedback for Doctor
e) Billing Vs Insurance Stats

Step 2: Analyzed the distinct count of Diagnosis and concluded that Viral Infection is the most occurred disease among the patients

Step 3: Imported data from excel to Power BI and transformed the data in power query editor 

Step 4: Added different visualizations like Cards to represent different metrics

Step 5: Added Slicer to represent how many patients were there in a particular date range

Step 6: For Bed Occupancy, we used column chart to represent the distinct count of types of bed occupancies

Step 7: For Rating - Feedback, I have used donut chart to represent feedback volume for doctors

Step 8: For Diagnosis type, I have used funnel chart

Step 9: For Insurance Vs. Total Amount comparison graph, I have used line chart

## Project Learnings:
- Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze Healthcare data
- Used complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
- Created connections, joined new tables, and performed calculations to manipulate data and enable user-driven parameters for visualizations
- Used different types of customized visualization (bar chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, scatter chart, line chart, area chart, map, slicers, etc.)
